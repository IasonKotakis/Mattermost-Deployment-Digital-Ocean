# Mattermost on Digital Ocean

In this project, we will demonstrate on how we can set up a server with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for free. 
We will then setup several tools such as [OTRS](https://otrs.com/), [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/), [NGINX](https://nginx.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/).

Lastly, since October is Cyber Security awareness month, we will make sure to encrypt everything with the help from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
